# PowerBI_Dashboard_Project
A Power BI dashboard for Krishna Store sales offers a comprehensive overview of the store's performance. It visualizes key metrics such as total sales, units sold, and revenue trends, allowing management to quickly assess overall business health. Visualizations like bar charts and pie chart help track growth, identify top-performing state, and measure sales against targets.
